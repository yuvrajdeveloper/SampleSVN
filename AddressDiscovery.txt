Here are the results of your organization's customizations scan. These entries represent existing
customizations that contain references to state or country fields. You will need to manually update
these customizations when you enable state and country picklists for your organization. Making the
updates ensures that your organization is using new code-based fields for states and countries,
instead of text-based fields.
